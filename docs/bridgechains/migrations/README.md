# Introduction

It is inevitable that, with Ark's high development velocity, networks will need to be upgraded and migrated to newer versions. Upgrading distributed systems can be especially tricky, as all participants, delegates and node operators will need to coordinate the migration together.

We provide migration guides for all major upgrades and support through our [Slack](https://ark.io/slack). Migrations can be quite tricky; proper planning is required beforehand to prevent network outages. If this is your first migration, we suggest going through all the guides first, even if some may seem less relevant to you. This will help you in understanding the general strategy and different risks.
