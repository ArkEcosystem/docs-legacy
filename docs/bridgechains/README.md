# Bridgechains

BridgeChains are code forks of the Ark blockchains, aimed at being interoperable with Ark mainnet through `smartbridges`. It provides a scalable solution to projects seeking their own, customized token without being impeded by network congestions.

Maintaining a BridgeChain does require in-depth technical knowledge. Ark does attempt to provide support, documentation, and tools to make this process as effortless as possible.

Before deploying a production BridgeChain, ensure you have read, understood and reread all documentation and tutorials.
