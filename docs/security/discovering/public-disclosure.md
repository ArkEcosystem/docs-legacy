# Public Disclosure

After we have assessed the risk and mitigated a vulnerability, it is publicly disclosed in our [dedicated repository](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/security-vulnerabilities). 

## Rewards program

Our rewards program encourages researchers to contribute to the security of the Ark Ecosystem through the following bounties:

We know that software will always have flaws that are hard to notice initially. As we take security of our network as a top priority, we provide a security/vulnerability bounty for bugs or errors in the ARK Core that could potentially harm or exploit the [Ark Network](https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/core).

### Critical: $5,000-$10,000

Encompasses critical vulnerabilities related to network control and chain integrity.

Examples:

- Creation of ARK outside of the scheduled forged inflation.
- Replay attacks on spent transactions
- Attacking node consensus and forking the network semi-permanently.

### High: $2,000-$3,000

Security vulnerabilities that are not related to funds or taking control of the network, but can still pose severe problems to the network.

Examples:

- Stopping the network for extended periods of time.
- Bringing the majority or all delegates offline.
- Corrupting the nodes' internal state machines.

### Medium: $500-$1,500

Issues that can cause temporary problems, but do not expose corrupt data or cause permanent harm.

Examples:

- Temporarily slowing down block propagation.
- Stopping the network for shorter period of times.
- Making replay attacks under some restricted circumstances.

### Low: $100-$300

Security vulnerabilities that usually have no impact on the whole blockchain infrastructure, but can still pose problems for some specific things.

Examples:

- Attacks which only affect single nodes and cannot harm the whole network.

Including a patch with your findings will also make you eligible for an additional 50% increase in reward.

## Eligibility

1. Never publicly disclose any exploit or vulnerability.
2. Never maliciously initiate an exploit on ARK Public Network, if you need to validate your setup use your own local Ark Network.
3. To receive the bounty, you must send an in-depth explanation in an email to [security@ark.io](mailto:security@ark.io) with the steps to reproduce the vulnerability and if possible a patch or PoC to negate the security vulnerability in question.

*Security vulnerabilities are paid in ARK based on the daily average rate before the payout as the terms are agreed upon by both parties.*

The Ark team may decide to deviate from the rewards program and security procedure without disclosing the underlying reasons.
