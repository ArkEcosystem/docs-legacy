# ARK Public API

This is the reference guide for the Public API. This API exposes all resources and data provided by an ARK Core node; and is the preferred way of interacting with the ARK network. Note that each node has its own internal blockchain and state, meaning it may have forked or be out of sync, causing queries to fail. Monitor your node by comparing it to different public nodes, such as the official [explorer](https://explorer.ark.io:8443/api) to ensure you are in sync.

The deprecated [v1 documentation](/archive/api/public-v1/) has been moved to the [Archive](/archive/).
