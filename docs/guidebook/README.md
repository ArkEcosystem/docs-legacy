# Guidebook

This is the Ark Ecosystem Developer Guidebook. After reading this, you'll be ready to build your own Ark-powered applications and blockchains -- perhaps with the help of some code from our tutorials.

The guidebook contains technical references and in coding tutorials that might overwhelm beginners. Ark community developers and the Ark Team can be contacted on [slack](https://ark.io/slack) and [gitter](https://gitter.im/ark-developers/Lobby) (less active). Do not hesitate to contact us, even if you feel the question is quite stupid and would inconvenience us.

If you intend to contribute to Ark, make sure you read the guidelines on proper [git](/guidebook/contribution-guidelines/git-commit-guidelines.md) usage and ask in advance if the Ark Team is working on a particular feature. In open-source projects, it is quite standard to first create an issue on GitHub before submitting a PR.
