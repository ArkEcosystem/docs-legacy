# Git Commit Guidelines

[[toc]]

## Introduction

These guidelines are based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and should be followed as closely as possible, or your pull-request is subject to rejection.

## Types

- `feat` A new feature
- `fix` A bug fix
- `docs` Documentation only changes
- `style` Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- `refactor` A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` A code change that improves performance
- `test` Adding missing or correcting existing tests
- `chore` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
- `deps` Adding, updating or removing dependencies
- `release` A new release, including changelog and version bump
- `misc` Any changes that do not fit any of the above types
