## Wallet Interface

The wallet interface page can be reached by clicking on the wallet icon in the navigation bar of the application. On it, you will be able to view your profile or individual wallet balance. Some shortcuts are also provided to create or import a wallet and view the details of one of your wallet.

### Wallet details
On the wallet detail page, which is accessed by clicking on the wallet's name or icon from the wallet interface, you can: 
 - send an ARK transfer
 - view and sort the wallet's transactions
 - vote for a registered delegate
 - sign and verify messages cryptographically
 - purchase ARK through [Changelly](https://changelly.com)
 - register a second passphrase for added security
 - register the wallet as a delegate

### Sending an ARK transfer

Transferring ARK from your wallet is the most common type of transaction.

You can easily send a transfer by clicking on the ***Send*** button in the header of the wallet detail page. This will bring up a prompt, on which you can fill in the required information to create a transfer transaction.

![Transfer Details](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/Transfer.png)

Upon clicking ***Next***, you will then have to review the transfer transaction's details and decide whether to submit it, discard it or save it by clicking ***Send***, ***Back*** or ***Save***.

![Submit Transfer](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SubmitTransfer.png)

### Voting for a Registered Delegate and Unvoting

Delegated Proof of Stake, the consensus algorithm used by the Ark Core, requires network participants to vote for delegates with their funds. A vote is not like a transfer, it is simply helps determine which delegates have the most support from network members. You may only vote for one delegate at a time and your funds are not locked while you are voting.

***Voting***
 - **Browse the list of registered delegates**
![Delegate List](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/Delegates.png)

 - **Choose the delegate you wish to vote for, review their statistics and click *Vote***
![Delegate Stats](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/DelegateStats.png)

 - **Fill in the required vote transaction fields and click *Next***
![Vote Fields](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/Vote.png)

 - **Submit, discard or save the vote transaction by pressing either *Send*, *Back* or *Save***
![Submit Vote](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SubmitVote.png)

***Unvoting***
 - **Open the list of registered delegates**
![Delegate List Unvote](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/DelegateListUnvote.png)

 - **Click on the *Unvote* button**
![Click Unvote Button](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/ClickUnvoteButton.png)

 - **Review the delegate's stats and click the *Unvote* button**
![Review Unvote](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/ReviewUnvote.png)

 - **Choose a transcation fee, enter your security details and click *Next***
![Unvote Details](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/UnvoteDetails.png)

 - **Submit the unvote transaction and Submit, Cancel or Save it by clicking either *Send*, *Back* or *Save***
![Submit Unvote](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SubmitUnvote.png)

### Signing and Verifying Messages

With the magic of cryptography, you are able to create and sign a message that other users will be able to verify as authentically yours.

Message signing and verifying is all done under the **Sign** tab of the wallet detail page.
#### Signing a Message

With a signed message, others can verify that a given message and signature combination originate from you.

 - **Input your security details and the message to sign, then click *Sign***
![Sign Message](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SignMessage.png)

 - **Your signed message will appear under the Sign tab of the wallet detail page**
![Signed Messages](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SignedMessages.png)

#### Verifying a Message

To verify a message that was signed by a different wallet, you need the wallet's public key, the original message and the resulting signature.

:::tip
The public key of a wallet is much like the address, except it doesn't follow the same format and is not shown by default in the Desktop Wallet. You can view your wallet's public key by clicking the key icon next to your wallet's address in the wallet detail page's header.
:::

For demonstration purposes, the images below are shown from the perspective of a second wallet, assuming the necessary details to verify the message were provided to the verifying user.

 - **Enter the message to verify, the public key of the wallet which was used to sign the message and the resulting signature, then click *Next***
![Verify Message](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/VerifyMessage.png)

 - **See whether the message was successfully verified or not**
![Verified Message](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/VerifiedMessage.png)

### Register as a Delegate

Registering as a delegate is a simple transaction. It provides network nodes with a record of the sending address opening itself to accept votes from other wallets. You can only vote for an address that was registered in this fashion.

 - **Expose more options in the wallet detail page by clicking the icon in the header**
![More Icon](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/MoreIcon.png)

 - **Click the *Register delegate* button**
![Register Delegate Button](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/RegisterDelegateButton.png)

 - **Enter your desired Username, Transaction fee and security details; then click *Next***
![Delegate Registration](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/DelegateRegistration.png)

 - **Verify the delegate registration transaction details and Submit, Cancel or Save it by clicking either *Send*, *Back* or *Save***
![Submit Delegate Registration](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SubmitDelegateRegistration.png)

### Register a Second Passphrase
Security is very important. By issuing a second signature transaction, you tell network nodes to verify that every transaction coming from your wallet is also signed by another Passphrase.

 - **Expose more options in the wallet detail page by clicking the icon in the header**
![More Icon](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/MoreIcon.png)

 - **Click the *Second passphrase* button**
![Second Signature Button](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SecondSignatureButton.png)

 - **Save your 12-word BIP39 second Passphrase and click *Next***
![Second Signature Passphrase Generation](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SecondSignatureGeneration.png)

 - **Prove that you have saved your second Passphrase, select your desired transaction fee, enter your security details and click *Next***
![Second Signature Details](./assets/how-to-use-the-desktop-wallet/new/SecondSignatureVerification.png)

 - **Verify the second signature transaction details and Submit, Cancel or Save it by clicking either *Send*, *Back* or *Save***
