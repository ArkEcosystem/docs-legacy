# How to Use the Mobile Wallet

The Ark Mobile Wallet is an easy to use, portable application. It enables you to manage all of your Ark accounts and view information about delegates. The wallet also provides an interface to add contacts by their address, which can save you some time when making transactions.

The application is built using the Ionic Framework, which enables the code base to be shared and functionally similar on both iOS and Android.

## Installation

Like any useful application, you'll be able to find the Ark Mobile Wallet application in your phone's store. It is completely free to download and use.

Download the wallet on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/mobile-ark/id1324625967?ls=1&mt=8) or the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.ark.wallet.mobile).

## Starting the Ark Wallet

Once you load the application you will be met with this screen:

![Image of Ark Welcome Screen](./assets/how-to-use-the-mobile-wallet/arkWallet.png)

The content of each slide shares some details about some security and usability features of the app.

After reading through the welcome slides, you will be able to create a profile.

After you hit the '*Create A Profile*' button, you will be prompted to create a 6 digit PIN confirm it afterwards.

**You will need to remember this PIN, it is very important.**

Your new profile must then be assigned a name and a network. The Mainnet is the one where your ARK tokens will be sent to and from. The Devnet is used for team members and contributors wishing to test additional functionality and should not be used. The remainder of this document assumes you've created a profile that uses the Mainnet.

Once you've placed your name, you can sign in by touching onto the profile you created and by entering in the PIN you created earlier. From there, you can click on the bottom-right button to either create or import a wallet. If you are importing a wallet, click [here](#importWallet). If you are creating a new wallet, continue reading.

## Creating a wallet

If you choose to generate a wallet and follow the prompts you will be shown your shareable Public Address and your Secret Passphrase. **Keep your secret passphrase safe and secure**, without it you will not be able to restore your wallet and you will lose all of your ARK tokens.

After hitting '*Next*', you will be asked to verify your Secret Passphrase. In order to encrypt your address, your PIN will be required. 

The next screen will show you the amount of ARK tokens you have in your wallets, your shareable Public Address, the Market Value of ARK in USD, Satishis, and the 24 hour Change.

## Importing a wallet

If you choose to import a wallet and follow the prompts, you will have two options to import your wallet: QR Code or by putting in your secret passphrase or address manually.

**If you decide to copy and paste your information into the app, make sure your device does not add a space after your passphrase or address. If the space is there, it will create a new wallet and not import your own wallet**.

## Voting

To begin voting, we need ARK in our wallets. Once you've transferred ARK to your wallet, you will want to click on the wallet that was either imported or generated.
