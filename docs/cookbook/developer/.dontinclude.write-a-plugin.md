### Ark Core
Make sure you have an up-to-date version of the Ark Core repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ArkEcosystem/core
cd core/
```
### Docker
Docker (docker-compose or docker-machine) is also required, it will help with running a local blockchain for testing and production purposes.

Please view instructions at the [official docker website](https://docker.io/get-started) for Windows and Mac.

For Linux Ubuntu, it can be installed with `sudo apt-get install docker-compose`.

With docker installed, you must run the development swarm by running `docker-compose up -d` in the `docker/development/` folder under the core repository.

### Yarn & Lerna
Install yarn and lerna if you don't have them already
```sh
npm i -g yarn
yarn global add lerna
```

Add ~/.yarn/bin to path
```sh
echo 'PATH=$PATH:~/.yarn/bin' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```
